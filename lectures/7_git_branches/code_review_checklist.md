1. Is the code understandable? (good variable names, appropriate comments, etc)
2. Does it compile? Does it run as it should?
3. Make sure that it is appropriate for the repository
4. Style consistency with the code base
5. Make sure there aren't "bad" files being added
  1. Big library dependencies (in general)
  2. Compiled code (no executables, no .o files)
  3. No binary files
6. Is the code adequately tested?
